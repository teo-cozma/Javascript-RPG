## First steps

### Day two (09/11) :
What are some of the difficulties we encountered ?

"Challenge 2 :
Use the character.js file and save the inputs inside variables/an object, and use them to initiate new characters for both players."

This is our main challenge. Trying to use the character script function to initiate our selection of characters, for which we have found images and names.
So we have the function onhand. How do we initiate it ? How do we incorporate said function into our code ?
