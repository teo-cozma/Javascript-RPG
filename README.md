## Day one (08/11) :

### Teaming up !
Teo and Brigita.

### First steps 
- [x] Set up the game space (canvas element) ;
- [x] (Attempting to) create characters (use JS objects) ;
    - Based on the character-script provided in the challenge description.

### Day two (09/11) :
What are some of the difficulties we encountered ?

"Challenge 2 :
Use the character.js file and save the inputs inside variables/an object, and use them to initiate new characters for both players."

This is our main challenge. Trying to use the character script function to initiate our selection of characters, for which we have found images and names.
So we have the function onhand. How do we initiate it ? How do we incorporate said function into our code ?

Challenge 1 : creating the HTML page with all the required elements. Focusing on this area of the project managed to get us focused again on the kind of game we had and wanted to create, and not get stuck entirely on the functions that had to be written. 
The other following challenges seemed very straight-forward in terms of what kind of HTML elements and tags needed to be researched and incorporated. Finding the progress tag to create the health bars and modifying the display style of the content that needed to appear or disappear were quite easy to implement.

### Day three (10/11) :

Challenges and steps : 
- [x] Finding the best (and free) images for our selection of characters (assassin, wizard, elf, orc) ;
- [x] Asking for a lot of help in figuring how to summon their images in the arena, which was initially in the form of a canvas element, but later converted to a regular div element.

### Day four (11/11) :

A couple of hours spent on some more game functions : making the labels, the player log and the game buttons (hit, heal, yield) all work properly. Very short but productive work session that covered pretty much these main functions.

### Day five (12/11) :

Pursuing the same work of the previous day and adding final touches to the stylesheet (colors, image sizes, overall layout of the creation panel and game arena). Some attempt to add more detail to the project with attack animations (which led to some very interesting and amusing results that unfortunately could not be implemented for the time being).

Creation of final 'Game over' and 'Victory' popup panels ; many small bugs had to be resolved in order to make the buttons properly disabled and enabled when certain conditions were met, as well as making sure that player input (name and character type) would still work well.

Also, realization of how useful creating functions can be in order to consolidate certain elements and their parameters, and summon them in other functions so that the game can work better and the code written more efficiently.

Later, game files pushed to repository and page launched.

### Post-project results (14/11) :

Google Lighthouse report : everything above 90 ! Inspecting and correcting the HTML, CSS and Javascript for more improvements (better identification, syntax, and meta description).

Final inspection and push.
